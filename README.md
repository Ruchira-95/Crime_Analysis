# Crime Analysis
## Academic mini project on the topic "PREDICTION AND ANALYSIS OF UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES".

### Abstract
The development of creative technical solutions has been sparked by the growing requirement for accurate crime research and forecasting. We provide a web-based tool in this research that anticipates and analyses crime trends, identifying crime hotspots for improved law enforcement techniques. Our website utilises the power of machine learning to build a predictive model using regression using the scikit-learn package on historical crime data provided by a CSV dataset. For quick retrieval and use, the model that has been trained then gets saved as a pickle file. A user-friendly web page that simplifies data input and presents the results was created using Flask and HTML. Additionally, for easier understanding, the Folium library was used to map out crime hotspots. Crime prediction, machine learning, regression analysis, Flask, HTML, pickle files, and Folium are some of the main terms connected to this project. With the help of this application, we hope to provide decision-makers and law enforcement with useful information for resource allocation and proactive crime prevention.

Key terms: crime prediction, machine learning, regression analysis, flask, html, pickle files, folium.


### Introduction
Crime is a major worry for people, communities, and governments all across the world. Despite 
the best efforts of law enforcement organizations, crime nevertheless poses a significant obstacle. 
The challenge of effectively anticipating criminal activity is one of the main causes of this. Illegal 
behaviour is frequently unpredictable, making it difficult to spot patterns and trends that can help 
with crime prevention.

In the area of crime analysis and prediction, machine learning algorithms and techniques have 
recently demonstrated potential. Machine learning models can help law enforcement agencies find 
high-risk areas and people and take preventive steps by analyzing past crime data and identifying 
patterns and trends. In order to lower crime rates and improve public safety, the creation of 
trustworthy and precise crime prediction systems can be extremely important.

In this undertaking, it is aimed to create a machine learning model for analyzing and predicting 
crime. The main goal is to develop a system that can correctly forecast future criminal activity by 
analyzing historical crime data. The model is made with the use of a dataset that includes details 
on a variety of offenses, including theft, burglary, assault, and homicide, as well as pertinent 
elements like time, place, and demographics. To analyze the data and identify significant patterns 
and trends a variety of algorithms and methods will be employed, including support vector 
machines, decision trees, and logistic regression. A variety of metrics, including accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's success


### Literature Survey
Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the use of machine learning approaches for crime analysis and prediction. For law enforcement agencies, being able to predict and analyse crime patterns with accuracy can offer useful insights that help with resource allocation and the creation of preventative programmes. This study of the literature focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms while exploring numerous studies and academic articles on crime analysis and prediction.

The use of machine learning in crime analysis and prediction is covered in the first reference by Roopa and Prof. Thouseef Ulla Khan [1]. Their work underscores the significance of using historical crime data to train models and the advantages for law enforcement organisations. Similar to this, Azwad Tamir et al. [2] present a study on crime forecasting and prediction using machine learning algorithms, showcasing the efficiency of such methods in pinpointing crime hotspots.

Another pertinent study by Pratibha Kumari et al. [3] examines crime prediction and analysis and offers details on how machine learning techniques are used in this field. Furthermore, B. Thanuja et al. [4] propose a study that uses machine learning methods built on Python to analyse crime rates. These studies aid in understanding how machine learning is used in real-world crime analysis and prediction.

The prediction of crime using deep learning and multimodal data is studied by Kang and Kang [5]. Their study demonstrates the possibility for merging several data sources to improve the precision of crime prediction. Additionally, Aziz et al.'s [6] proposal for a machine learning-based approach to soft computing regression analysis for crime data prediction provides insights into more sophisticated regression methods.

Numerous more sources examine various facets of crime study and forecasting. For instance, M.K. Anser et al. [8] look into the dynamic relationships between poverty, inequality, crime, and social expenditures, whereas V. Srinidhi et al. [7] use learning approaches to analyse crime scenes. Andrey Bogomolov et al. [10] explore crime prediction using mobile data and demography, while M. Suhail et al. [9] concentrate on quantile-based estimate of crime data parameters. The last complete evaluation of crime analysis and prediction utilising data mining approaches is provided by Shanjana A.S. and Dr. R. Porkodi [11].

In this literature review, we will analyse the approaches, algorithms, and assessment criteria used in crime analysis and prediction and synthesise the outcomes from these studies. We'll also point out the benefits and drawbacks of current methods and suggest possible directions for further investigation. By reviewing this corpus of work, we hope to offer a thorough overview of the state of machine learning research in crime analysis and prediction, ultimately assisting in the creation of more precise and effective crime prediction systems.
